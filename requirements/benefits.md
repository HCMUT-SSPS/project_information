# The benefits of SSPS

HCMUT-SSPS provides substantial benefits to its major customers, the students. Students may efficiently print their coursework, assignments, and reports without needless hassles if they have access to an intuitive and simple-to-use printing solution. The technology enables them to quickly submit papers, select the best printing options, and readily track their printing usage, ensuring they have the necessary tools at hand. This results in time savings, a decrease in frustration, and an improved academic experience overall.

Printing services are provided for faculty and instructors to use for assignments and lesson materials. This makes it simpler for them to create and disseminate course materials, which improves the efficiency of teaching. Thanks to the service's availability and accessibility, instructors can use it to make sure that their lesson plans are easily accessible to students when they need them, promoting a more effective learning environment. A study in America in 2020 found that a ‘single teacher typically uses between 25-75 pages every day for handing out tests, homework and resources to students and that the average amount of paper used in an entire school per day is 2,000 pages.’

The SPSO's duties are ultimately made easier due to improved administrative control, enhanced safety, and well-maintained printing infrastructure. The system optimizes the operation of the service by enabling effective management of numerous system settings, such as file types, default page allocations, and printing dates. The printer fleet may also be effortlessly maintained and monitored, ensuring that students always have access to printing resources.

The HCMUT-SSPS provides numerous advantages to the university administration. The system's reporting features offer insightful data on resource utilization, spending, and printing trends. Making informed decisions about resource allocation, system upgrades, and budgeting is made easier with the help of this data. According to a survey of more than 1,000 senior executives conducted by PwC, highly data-driven organizations are three times more likely to report significant improvements in decision-making compared to those who rely less on data. This will help the administrators to make better decisions in the future for students and universities.
