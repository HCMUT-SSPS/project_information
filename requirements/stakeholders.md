# Stakeholders and their needs

Students are the main HCMUT-SSPS users. They need an easy-to-use printing solution so they can quickly print their coursework, assignments, reports, and other papers. Students must be able to submit papers quickly, select the best printing settings, and keep track of their printing usages. Some “faculty and Instructors” may also have the same needs as the student to print teaching materials and assignments for their courses.

The printing service must be managed by the SPSO (or Student Printing Service Officer). Their requirements include managing system settings (such as allowed file types, default page allocations, and printing dates), maintaining and monitoring the printer fleet.
The HCMUT-SSPS report gives the university administration insights about printing trends, expenditures, and resource usage. This information can help with resource allocation choices, system upgrades, and budgeting. The printing service may also need to be coordinated with the university's sustainability objectives.

The HCMUT-SSPS relies heavily on the “IT Department” to keep the servers reliable, ensuring network connectivity, and maintaining the technical infrastructure. The “Financial Department” of the institution also has specific requirements. They call for thorough monitoring of payments for the printing service and open financial reporting. These requirements are essential for maintaining the printing service's solid financial management.
